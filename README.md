About Me

Hello! My name is Jonathan Khou and I am an Industrial Engineer at Walt Disney World Parks and Resorts!
Here to leverage the flexibility, data structures, and accessibility of GitHub. Looks like a great collaboration environment, and I am excited for its applications to my work!

Keep coding on!
